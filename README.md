# Instructions
Go to either the Pairwise Ising model, or Pairwise-Indepeendet model folders to run the algorithms. Only the toy-dataset is available, since the other data used in my thesis belong to the "Blue Brain Project".  Hence, only the Pairwise-Ising model can be tested, whereas the Pairwise-Indepeendet simplex model is problematic if not  

 The datasets are available in the dataset folder in a zip file, open it to make it. Use py2.7 and conda 4.3.30.
